# N64 ROM Loader for Ghidra by Warranty Voider

this is a loader module for ghidra for N64 roms (.z64, .n64, .v64)
- fixes endianess (little, big, mixed) at loading
- loads ram, rom and boot section into ghidra
- it can use a signature/pattern file to scan for symbol hints for ghidra

this allows a rom to be labeled, disassembled and decompiled
