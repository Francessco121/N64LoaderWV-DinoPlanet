# N64 ROM Loader for Ghidra by Warranty Voider

this is a loader module for ghidra for the Dinosaur Planet ROM
- fixes endianess (little, big, mixed) at loading
- loads ram, rom and boot section into ghidra
- it can use a signature/pattern file to scan for symbol hints for ghidra

Dinosaur Planet specific functionality
- resolves DLL import tables so that DLL-local code is properly referencing function addresses, strings, and other constants
- initializes each DLL function named after their DLL, as well as object name if any
- sets up GP register for each DLL so it can read stuff. the game patches its own assembly for this at runtime
- attempts to make decent-ish references for global DLLs using a fake redirection table in-place of the runtime DLL table - however results may vary
- also note this is the first thing i wrote in java (and hopefully the last) so apologies for inconsistencies in naming conventions etc.

this allows a rom to be labeled, disassembled and decompiled

**requires JDK 13**

## Build from Source (Mac)

```bash
brew install java
brew install gradle
brew cask install ghidra

export GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=`brew cask ls ghidra | grep ghidra | sed 's/^.*-> \(.*\)ghidraRun.*/\1/'`
```

Then whenever you're ready to build, run

```bash
gradle
```

and it will create a zip file in `/dist` that you can use that file as the extension in Ghidra

## Build from Source (Linux)

install java15, gradle, and ghidra, on arch linux (substitute as needed for apt, yum, or what have you):

```pacman -S jdk15-openjdk gradle ghidra```

Clone the repo and cd to the N64LoaderWV directory

```git clone https://github.com/zeroKilo/N64LoaderWV.git```

if ghidra is in your PATH (you may need to use ghidraRun instead of ghidra depending on distro):

```GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=$(dirname $(readlink -fe $(which ghidra))) gradle```

else set GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR to where you manually installed ghidra to (e.g $HOME/bin) or add ghidra's location to PATH
